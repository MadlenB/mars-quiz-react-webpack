## Summary

I was excited about the idea that I can build many smaller React Component to make websites and/or apps with React. The re-use ablity is amazing and its performance is superb.

Setting up webpack for the first time was a bit tricky. I soon realized what a handy tool to have when webpack was all set up and running. 

Tthe @keyframes animations was one of the things I enjoyed the most in this project. I made the rocket icon-font to increases its size as it animates movement up-word. Such as 2D technique to mimic 3D effects.
